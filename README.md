## 🤝 Let's Build Something Amazing Together

I'm not just looking for opportunities - I'm looking for **problems worth solving**. 

**🔍 What I'm hunting for**: 
- Internships where I can ship AI products that real people use
- Projects that challenge me to learn something completely new
- Teams that believe in building first, perfecting later

**💡 What gets me excited**: 
- Computer Vision projects (making machines see is pure magic)
- Healthcare AI (because everyone deserves better health insights)
- NLP applications (teaching machines to understand humans)
- MLOps challenges (because great models deserve great deployment)

**🎯 My 2024 Mission**: 
- Contribute to **open-source ML projects** that matter
- Complete **advanced AI certifications** (TensorFlow, AWS ML)
- Land a **meaningful internship** where I can make real impact
- Build an AI project that gets featured on **ProductHunt** 

**☕ Coffee Chat Topics**: AI ethics, the future of work, why transformers changed everything, and how to explain gradient descent using pizza 🍕

Hit me up if you're building something cool, need a passionate AI developer, or just want to discuss why Python is the best language ever invented!
